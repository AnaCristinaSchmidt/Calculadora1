## ðŸ§  Sprint 1 â€“ Calculator

For this sprint, the proposal was to model a **calculator**, developed 100% with **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.

The project was completed in just 3 days and did not present any major technical difficulties, but it was essential to apply initial concepts of structure, logic and style in practice.
